# ruby-c500

This is a buggy, work-in-progress clone of https://github.com/vgel/c500/. Some TODOs are from the original project, some are mine.

You can download the original python code, `compiler.py` and stick in this folder, it can then be compared against the ruby compiler with `./compare_compilers <some_file.c>`. The zsh script was generated by chatgpt.

The ruby compiler can be run on its own with `bundle exec ruby compiler.rb <some_file.c>`.

Tests (which just compare ruby to python output) can be run with `make test`.
