# ruby-c500

This is a buggy, work-in-progress clone of https://github.com/vgel/c500/. 

It includes the original python code, which can be compared against the ruby compiler with `./compare_compilers <some_file.c>`. The zsh script was generated by chatgpt.

The ruby can be run standlone with `bundle exec ruby compiler.rb <some_file.c>`.
